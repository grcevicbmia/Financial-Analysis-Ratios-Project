### Tax Schedule & Income Statement

The income statement is one of the most important financial statements for a company. It shows the profits and losses over a specific period.

In order to find the profits or losses at the end of the year, there is the subtraction of the profits and the expenses. The income statement gives strong indications of the business’s financial position over a specific period.

For our analysis, we have the business’s income statement from the year 2021.

During that year the company’s sales were 4.5 million dollars. This number is very strong, considering the fact that 2021 was a pandemic-plagued year.

Also in a very uncertain economic environment, with costs increasing rapidly due to the pandemic, the company managed to keep its costs at around 2.5 million dollars, a figure which is much lower than the sales.

A very important part of the income statement is EBIT. EBIT stands for earnings before interest and taxes and includes the business’s revenues and expenses before taxation.

In our case, EBIT was at 1.930 million dollars.

Below is the income statement from the company , in the year 2021:

In the income statement table above we can see that the total amount of money that can be taxed is equal to $1,800,000.00.

When we distribute this amount to the taxable income ranges and pay the taxes we get the amount of $574,750 taxes paid.

By dividing the total amount of taxes paid by the total amount of taxable income we get that the average tax rate is equal to 32%  (574,750.00/1,800,000.00 = 0.32 * 100 = 32%). 

The marginal tax rate equals 34% since the additional dollar can be put into the same taxable range.

### Cash Flow Statement

Cash Flow statement plays an important role for every company since it shows the results of the company’s operating, investing, and financial activities.

Acknowledging this, we can further comment on Demeter Restaurant’s financial performance for the year 2021.

We proceeded with assessing Demeter's operating activity. We can determine that operating activities brought in $1,211,850.00 from the preceding table.

This figure illustrates the profit generated by Demeter Restaurant's primary business activities.

These activities include processes such as producing and selling products, but since this is a restaurant, we refer to our exceptional service and food produced. 

To give feedback on operating activities, we took into consideration the Balance sheet from 2020 and 2021 and precisely looked into differences made in accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory in these two fiscal years.

Taking all calculations, we received our net cash from operating activities.

<img width="954" height="581" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56e6b639-3abf-4d9e-a66f-811379adf0d3" />

In the table shown above, we can find information about the investment activities of Demeter Restaurant. 

The profit that was earned by the investment activities is $1,375,400.00. In the investment activities, we take into consideration sales, asset purchases, and the expenditure of capital.

The value is positive, indicating the restaurant got a cash inflow from the investment activities.

Demeter Restaurant sold one of its properties in Greece in 2021 since the location didn’t show successful results as others did. In the future, the team is planning to invest in other locations.

Lastly, we will analyse the financial activities of our firm, which concern the long-term debt and the dividends that need to be paid out.

The result we got is a positive value of $887,225.00. This number allows the firm to cover all of its financial needs.

The LTD that the firm has is due to the purchase of the necessary decorations for our restaurant, therefore the firm needed to borrow money from the bank. 

Having everything mentioned above in mind, we can conclude that Demeter Restaurant has witnessed a positive increase in cash with a value of $733,675.00. 

This number is an indication that the firm's cash flow management was prosperous.

Last but not least, we will comment on the cash balance at the end of the year 2021, which shows us the value of $948,675.00. This number was provided by adding the value from the beginning of the year and the net addition to the cash. 

All the tables above show results that satisfy our financial managers. Moreover, they show the financial stability and great perspective for the financial growth of our restaurant.

### Liquidity Ratios

#### Current Ratio

The capacity of a business to pay down short-term debt is shown through the current ratio. It shows a company's state of financial well-being and how to get the most out of its current assets in order to pay off debt and other obligations. 

In this case, the 2020 and 2021 current ratios are 0.494 and 0.962, meaning if a business's current ratio is less than 1, it doesn't have enough resources to meet all of its short-term responsibilities. 

Additionally, the quick ratio can be evaluated in the same way. It is understandable why the restaurant’s business was not blooming, since in the year 2020, the coronavirus has spread the most.

However, a year later, the company was able to rapidly raise the ratio to 0.9. We computed the ratios using the current assets divided by the current liabilities formula.

2020

(853,000.00)/(1,725,000.00) = 0.494

2021

(1,717,875.00)/(1,784,600.00) = 0.962

#### Quick Ratio

Although the two ratios appear similar in a greater perspective, the key difference is that the quick ratio determines how well the business can fulfill immediate liquidity requirements.

(Current Assets - Inventory)/ Current Liabilities

2020

(853,000.00 - 328,000.00) / 725,000.00 = 0.304

2021

(1,717,875.00 - 393,000.00) / 1,784,600.00 = 0.742

### Leverage Ratios

#### Debt to Asset Ratio

The debt-to-asset ratio analyses how much of the business's assets have been purchased by debt. The greater the ratio, the larger the percentage of debt financing and the higher the chance that the company may experience bankruptcy problems.

A low debt-to-assets ratio is typically considered beneficial as it suggests that a company is not dependent upon the use of debt to fund its assets.

As we can see, with generally reduced debt ratios and competent debt management, the company has remained steady.

Total Debt / Total Assets

2020

(2,308,000.00) / (7,380,000.00) = 0.3127 or 31,27%

2021

(3,561,000.00) / (9,550,275.00) = 0.3728 or 37,28%

#### Coverage of Fixed Charges

The coverage of the fixed charge ratio analyses the cash flow capacity to fulfill fixed charge responsibilities. A business may face financial problems if it is unable to pay its debts.

For this reason, it is preferable to have a higher coverage of fixed charges ratio. Additionally, number 15, the outcome of our ratio analysis is an indicator that the company is capable of covering the interest expenses.

(EBIT + Depreciation) / Interest

(1,930,000.00 + 70,000.00) / 130,000.00 = 15,384 times

### Turnover Ratios

#### Asset Turnover Ratio

The asset turnover ratio determines how effectively a business uses its assets to generate profits. It is preferable to have a greater ratio since it shows that assets are being used more productively. 

A smaller ratio suggests that the business is not making as good use of its resources.

In this case, we can see that the ratio is not favorable, and it indicates that the resources were not used effectively. 

On the other hand, we cannot ignore the fact that CoronaVirus affected negatively, not only our business but also other restaurants in the world.

Sales / Total Assets

2020

(4,500,000.00) / (7,380,000.00) = 0.609

2021

(4,500,000.00) / (9,550,000.00) = 0.471

#### Average Collection Period

Known as the average collection period, it represents the amount of time it takes a business to get payments in the form of accounts receivable.

Any business can benefit from knowing its average collection period since it gives them a better understanding of how well they are collecting the funds they require to pay for their expenses.

The shorter the average collection period, the better for the business. 

A shorter average collection period indicates quicker payment gathering for the business. 

365 / (Sales / Acc. Receivable) 

365 / (4,500,000.00 / 372,000.00) = 30,173 days

### Profitability Ratios

#### Return on Equity

Analyses the percentage of return on the overall investment made in the business by shareholders.

Since in this case we do not have any investment in shareholder equity, there is no return on equity. 

Net Income / Shareholder’s Equity

#### Earnings per Share

For creditors, earnings per share is a crucial financial indicator since it offers a clear picture of the business's performance.

A business's equity is considered as better value by creditors when its earnings per share is greater.

Net Income / 100,000.00

12.1225 - Average Number of Common Shares

### Market Value Ratios

#### Price/earnings ratio

The correlation between the price of a business's shares and earnings per share is known as the price/earnings ratio.

The lower the ratio, creditors might see it as an opportunity to buy.

In this case, the ratio is low, which indicates that the restaurant’s funds weigh less than its earnings.

Price per share / EPS

0.82

#### Dividend Payout Ratio

The percentage of the net profit that is paid out as dividends to shareholders is calculated by the dividend payout ratio.

A lower dividend payout ratio indicates that more money is being invested by the business in growing it.

With this ratio being relatively low, we are confident that it will help the firm in the long-run expansion.

Dividends Paid / Net Income

(365,775.00) / (1,219,250.00) = 0.3 or 30%
